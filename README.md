Create a Dapp, "CHai " ,,, It is mainly used to receive ethers from others as a reward.
The user also sends their name and a lovely message to the owner of the CHai some ethers.

Technology use:-
1. Solidity language for writing smart contracts.
2. Hardhat used for deploying smart contracts.
3. Ether.js for connecting fronted to the smart contract.
4. Javascript and react framework for writing some logic and making fronted.
5. Goerli test network used for sending ethers.
6. Metamask for connecting wallet address and use in interacting with CHai dapp.





# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
